# Pulseless Peristaltic Colloid Extruder
Keep in mind this is still a prototype!

## Abstract
This project provides a blueprint of a cheap stepper-driven colloid extruder for FDM 3D printers.
Parts are generic/replicatable with your 3D printer, and installation only requires a slight mod of your desktop FDM.

## Design Features
* Comprise only 3D printable main components & off-the-shelf generic parts
* Runs with typical NEMA 17 geared stepper
* Special peristaltic pump featuring pulse-offsetting mechanism
* Scaleable

## Advantages to Other Solutions
There have been many attempts of colloid extruders for 3D printing before. Many of them use cyringe mounted on the toolhead - the problem with this approach is that the toolhead becomes very heavy, or you are limited to very little material mounted, resulting frequent halt for material loading. Narrow syringes are neccessary to meet whatever requisite high pressure needed - but then the volume of the cyringe becomes so little (or you need a awkwardly long cyringe), and material feed becomes even more inefficient. 

There are other solutions like the moinueau pump, which enables continuous, pulse-free colloid extrusion. However those parts are expensive and far from commoditized. They are also prone to corrosion and hard to maintain.

This project aims to provide a cheap solution which everybody could use to 3D print various colloids like clay / gell / lime plaster. 

## Environment
The first CAD work has been done with Rhinoceros5. For modifications by other CAD users, .STEP files will be exported.

Have fun!!
